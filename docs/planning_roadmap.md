# How to build it?
I'll probably build multiple versions. This is a tentative order, but Vanilla Django will be first.
- Vanilla Django
- Django & htmx
- Django w/ Django Ninja to add an API (for mobile or CLI apps?)
- FastAPI?


## Build/Deploy Timeline
- Get an MVP done before PyTexas (2025-04-10), so I can try it at the Thursday night pre-conf game
- Use it again in Pittsburg during PyCon US (2025-05)
- REALLY give it a test during PaizoCon Online
- Try it again at ChupacabraCon
- Refine b/w each use
